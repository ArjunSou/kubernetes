```sh
1. Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes.
2. As an operating system package manager makes it easy to install tools on an OS, Helm makes it easy to install applications
   and resources into Kubernetes clusters
2. It lets us treat our Kubernetes apps as apps instead of just a collection of objects, and this takes a huge burden from our
   shoulders as we don't have to micromanage each Kubernetes object anymore.
3. Using HELM we can install, upgrade, rollback and uninstall the most complicated k8s application  easily without any overhead.
